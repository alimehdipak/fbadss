Nias joined the Denver Zoo at the age of 17 in 2005 and has spent the last 15 years entertaining visitors and working as an advocate for her threatened species.<\/p>\n<p>Her two daughters, Hesty, 10, and Cerah, 2, were frequently seen caring for and playing with her. At this point, we do not know what caused Nias\u2019 death and are awaiting the findings of a necropsy performed by our partners at Colorado State University\u2019s College of Veterinary Medicine &#038; Biomedical Services.<br \/>\nNias was renowned as the \u201cQueen Bee\u201d of the Great Apes display at the Zoo. Her caretakers knew not to offer a reward to another orangutan unless they intended to give it to Nias as well, and her mate, Berani, always followed her lead. Until Hesty became more independent, she kept a close eye on her, never letting her out of her sight. As Cerah, born in 2018, was added to the family, Nias calmed, and visitors noticed her swinging around on her own, still under mom\u2019s cautious eye.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Heart-Melting-Orangutan-Father-Raises-His-Daughter-On-His-Own-After-His-Wifes-Death3-1-300x282.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"282\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1588\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Heart-Melting-Orangutan-Father-Raises-His-Daughter-On-His-Own-After-His-Wifes-Death3-1-300x282.jpg 300w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Heart-Melting-Orangutan-Father-Raises-His-Daughter-On-His-Own-After-His-Wifes-Death3-1.jpg 678w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>KIRO7\u2019s Cindy Cossaboon, Primate Keeper Cindy Cossaboon, who has been with Nias since her first day at the Zoo, reported that it was fantastic to witness this huge male with this tiny, little infant.  \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where you have this terrible storm, and then you have the rainbow at the end. He is doing a fantastic job. We couldn\u2019t ask for better care for her.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As a loving father, Nias comforts his daughter whenever she cries, cuddling with her when she goes to sleep or cries at night.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Heart-Melting-Orangutan-Father-Raises-His-Daughter-On-His-Own-After-His-Wifes-Death2-1-300x281.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"281\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1589\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Heart-Melting-Orangutan-Father-Raises-His-Daughter-On-His-Own-After-His-Wifes-Death2-1-300x281.jpg 300w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Heart-Melting-Orangutan-Father-Raises-His-Daughter-On-His-Own-After-His-Wifes-Death2-1.jpg 676w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Cossaboon added that not many individuals got to have the kind of bond I have with these animals.
