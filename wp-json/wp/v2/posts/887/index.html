He almost passed out from starving and seemed to have no chance of surviving, but later, he could be happy again thanks to kindness and love. Let\u2019s read the whole moving story of this miserable yet adorable furry angel!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-882\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-8-300x225.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-8-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-8.png 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When the police shut down a drug raid at a residence, they found a weak, dirty dog there, so they seized and brought him to the local animal shelter. Unfortunately, the place was already out of rooms, and no space was available for him. Carers wrapped him in a blanket and put him in the intake area while other staff called for help.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-892\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-4-1-300x225.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-4-1-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-4-1.png 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Holden was scared and shaky. He weighed only 25 pounds, about 15 pounds less than a regular individual of his breed. Whenever he saw food or a bowl, he tried to reach for it. Holden was so hungry and defeated. As if all of that weren\u2019t traumatizing enough for the poor little guy, a large tumor was found in his abdomen via the X-ray film. The veterinarian estimated it was about seven pounds and prevented the dog from consuming nutrition.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-893\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-5-1-225x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-5-1-225x300.png 225w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-5-1-300x400.png 300w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-5-1.png 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Heartwarmingly and surprisingly, despite being in limbo, malnourished, and sick, Holden appeared happy and wagged his tail joyfully right after getting bandaged and fawned by a nurse. Not only that, he reacted enthusiastically to every voice that sounded gentle and kind to him. He treasured even the slightest affecting gestures.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-891\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-3-1-225x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-3-1-225x300.png 225w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-3-1-300x400.png 300w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-3-1.png 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The vet quickly operated on and removed the tumor from Holden\u2019s body. The procedure went well, and he woke up from the operation. Even though he still endured anesthetic effects and couldn\u2019t lift his head yet, his tail responded instantly to the sound of a kind voice. In addition, he was always a good and delightful boy during the treatment.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-897\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-9-1-300x153.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"153\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-9-1-300x153.jpg 300w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-9-1.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-897\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-9-1-300x153.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"153\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-9-1-300x153.jpg 300w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-9-1.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Next, it was time to settle a new life for Holden. He was taken care of by Releash Atlanta, a non-profit volunteer charitable organization that works tirelessly to save dogs from high-kill shelters throughout the state of Georgia. Holden felt sorrowful for saying goodbye to people at the vet and sat sadly in the back of Ashley\u2019s car when she voluntarily picked him up. Thus, she cheered him up by hugging and snapping with him.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-894\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-6-1-172x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"172\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-6-1-172x300.png 172w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-6-1-588x1024.png 588w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-6-1-300x523.png 300w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-6-1.png 620w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 172px) 100vw, 172px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-895\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-7-1-225x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-7-1-225x300.png 225w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-7-1-300x400.png 300w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-7-1.png 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Afterward, Melissa Lentz, a seasoned foster mom for scared little dogs, gave Holden a temporary roof and helped with his recovery. He soon made friends with Lentz\u2019s daughter and nine other pups living at her foster house. Lentz revealed Holden was never a choosing eater. He always had a good appetite, which helped him make big progress. Besides, some good news came back from the vet office: The preliminary tests on Holden\u2019s tumor showed it was probably benign.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-876\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-2-225x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-2-225x300.png 225w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-2-300x400.png 300w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hol-2.png 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>After getting the biopsy result and doing several dental and neutering fixing-ups, Lentz found Holden a happy, loving family.
