Luckily, he has good parents who always understand and give the best things for him. They know that Kufus is inseparable from that spot, so they decided to give him the entire sofa and buy another one for their own. They reserved that spot for their beloved Kufus, no one could sit on his spot, even their guests.<\/p>\n<p>In the video footage of Kufu, when his mom told him it was bedtime, he was slumping onto the sofa and burying his head in the blanket. Another time, when his mom tried to bribe him with grapes to get him out of the sofa, smart Kufus accepted the grapes then quickly flops back down onto the sofa. His lovely action right away melted down thousands of hearts on Instagram.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-963\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Rescued-Kangaroo-Loves3-300x144.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Rescued-Kangaroo-Loves3-300x144.jpg 300w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Rescued-Kangaroo-Loves3.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-964\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Rescued-Kangaroo-Loves4-300x144.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Rescued-Kangaroo-Loves4-300x144.jpg 300w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Rescued-Kangaroo-Loves4.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-965\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Rescued-Kangaroo-Loves5-300x163.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"163\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Rescued-Kangaroo-Loves5-300x163.jpg 300w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Rescued-Kangaroo-Loves5.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Kim and her husband, Neil, are very happy to have Rufus in their life.
