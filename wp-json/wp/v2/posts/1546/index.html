And even though they love to hang out with dad Ujian (24) and mom Sari (15) too, their son Berani (4) is still their favorite playmate.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Affectionate-Otters-Swim-Through-Their-Enclosure-Everyday-To-Meet-An-Orangutan-Family-5-300x177.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"177\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1548\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Affectionate-Otters-Swim-Through-Their-Enclosure-Everyday-To-Meet-An-Orangutan-Family-5-300x177.jpg 300w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Affectionate-Otters-Swim-Through-Their-Enclosure-Everyday-To-Meet-An-Orangutan-Family-5.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe otters hide under large tree trunks or wooden constructions, then Berani, the baby orangutan, comes to look for them.
