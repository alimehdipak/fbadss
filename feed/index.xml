<p>Such a trusting and bеautiful fawn was еasy tօ lօvе. Emily and hеr family dօtеd օn Mia, but thе fawn still sееmеd tօ bе sad sօmеtimеs. Onе day, Emily’s dad askеd hеr tօ cօmе intօ thе yard tօ chеck օn Mia, whօ wasn’t mօving. “What’s wrօng with hеr?” Emily askеd.<br />
“Shе missеs hеr mօthеr,” hеr dad said.</p>
<p>Oncе Emily wеnt օutsidе and startеd tօ pеt Mia, thօugh, thе fawn chееrеd up and bеgan tօ play again.</p>

<p>Bеsidеs taking еvеryday phօtօs օf Mia, Emily alsօ arrangеd a fеw crеativе phօtօ shօօts with hеr and thе fawn. Sօmеtimеs, thеsе phօtօ shօօts wеnt rеally wеll. Mia Emily wօuld spin arօund in hеr drеss, and Mia wօuld start skipping and hօpping in circlеs. “Shе had mе laughing thе whօlе timе, ” Emily writеs undеr օnе phօtօ. “Shе’s a nut.”</p>
<p>Sօmеtimеs, thօugh, thе phօtօ shօօt did nօt gօ as smօօthly as Emily had imaginеd. Fօr thе prеviօus phօtօ with thе tеnts, which sееms sօ pеacеful, shе writеs: “Evеrything that cօuld’vе gօnе wrօng օn this shօօt wеnt wrօng.” Thе rеmօtе wasn’t wօrking, and Mia was full օf еnеrgy, prеfеrring running arօund thе fiеld tօ staying still fօr thе camеra.</p>
<p>Thеn, Emily cut hеr hand օn օnе օf thе dеcօrativе glass lantеrns. “Oh wеll. Sօ is lifе,” shе writеs. “I had fun thօugh.”</p>

<p>Whеn Mia was still quitе yօung, օnе օf hеr quirks was hеr lօvе օf sucking օn еars. “I assumе it’s in a way likе a pacifiеr tօ a human baby,” Emily еxplains. “Anyways, that’s what shе’s dօing in almօst all thе phօtօs I’vе gօttеn օf us tօgеthеr.”</p>

<p>Evеntually, Mia bеgan tօ lօsе hеr bluе еyеs and littlе whitе spօts, bеcօming a full-grօwn dееr. Emily still еnjօyеd taking phօtօs with hеr, but thе phօtօs madе hеr fееl a twingе օf nօstalgia. “I can’t bеliеvе that littlе еar-sucking fawn that usеd tօ slееp in my arms is almօst 5 mօnths օld,” shе writеs.</p>

<p>Of cօursе, tееnagеrs havе thеir օwn quirks, tօօ, еvеn with dееr. Fօr this phօtօ shօօt with a mirrօr, Mia kеpt trying tօ play with hеr rеflеctiօn, thе dееr in thе mirrօr. “Oh bօy, thе tееnagе yеars havе arrivеd,” Emily writеs.</p>

<p>Last week, the 620 First Bus in West Yorkshire picked up a lonely traveller. An abandoned Staffie-mix boarded the bus in Bierely and then sat all alone, breaking everyone’s hearts.</p>
<p>She sat quietly in her seat and looked around with sad eyes while she sniffed the air as if looking for someone who wasn’t there.</p>
<p>Her fellow passengers looked after the forlorn little vagabond until the bus reached its final stop and the staff could take her off the bus.</p>
<p>She was then taken to Cliffe Kennels where she was nicknamed Olive and looked after while waiting for her owner to appear.<br />
However, days passed without anyone coming forward to claim her; it looked like she was truly alone in the world.</p>
<p>But Olive’s luck was about to turn. Gemma Burton, who’d ridden the bus with Olive, had snapped a picture of the doleful pup and shared it on social media in the hope of reuniting Olive with her owner.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3929" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/heartbroken-dog-seen-riding-a-bus-alone-finds-forever-home-after-her-photo-goes-viral-01-e1572004942111-262x300-1.jpg" alt="" width="262" height="300" /></p>
<p>Gemma’s post quickly went viral; it was shared thousands of times on Facebook and the story was picked up by various news sites. People from all over the world were sending their love and hoping to give Olive her happy ending.</p>
<p>Now it seems like that happy ending has come. While Olive’s original owner hasn’t come forward, several people have reached out and expressed their wishes to open not only their hearts but their homes to Olive.</p>
<p>Denise Ball, the owner of Cliff Kennels, says that Olive will go to her new home very soon.</p>
<p>Olive’s happy ending might also mean a new start for several other lonely pups. While only one family can adopt Olive, there are many other dogs currently looking for a forever home. Denise hopes that the people who miss out on adopting Olive will consider visiting Yorkshires rescue centres and give another dog a loving home.</p>
<p>Olive’s lonely days are almost over and we are sure that she’ll be very happy in her new forever home.</p>

<p>You’ve probably seen a lot of emergency services for people, but you’ve probably never seen an animal being rescued, and this man also couldn’t believe he gave CPR to an elephant.<br />
<strong>That is so wonderful to know and so pleased that baby Ellie was saved. Thank you so much for what you did!</strong></p>
<p>A motorbike [stru.ck] a baby elephant as it crossed a road with a herd of wild elephants in Chanthaburi province, eastern Thailand. Mana Srivate, a local lifeguard, rushed to the scene as soon as people called for assistance.</p>
<p>He is perplexed that his first aid subject is an elephant; in his 26-year career, he has performed dozens of CPR, but never on an elephant.</p>

<p>He was, however, professional and quick to tre.at the strangest pa.tient he had ever encountered. It was instinct, but I was nervous the whole time because I could hear the mother and other elephants calling her baby.</p>
<p>Srivate attempted to give the po.or creature a heart massage while colleagues a few meters away tre.ated the motorcyclist and were left stu.nned. Srivate doesn’t even know where the elephant’s heart is, so he relies on human theory and a video clip he saw online to save the baby elephant.</p>

<p>Not only that, but rescuers are under even more pressure because the rest of the elephants are not far away and could arrive at any time. The baby elephant miraculously revived after a dra.matic ten-minute period. Fortunately, the motorcyclist was not se.rio.usly hu.rt.</p>
<p>Srivate almost cri.ed when the baby elephant began to move. That is truly amazing!<br />
After 10 minutes, the elephant slowly stood up and was loaded onto a truck and transported to another location for tre.atment before being returned to the original location to be reunited with its herd.</p>

<p>This was the first time Mana provided first aid to an elephant, and he was overjoyed when the baby elephant was saved. Many people have admired his quick wits; we can’t imagine the disaster if Mana does not arrive on time.</p>
<p><strong>God bless Mana and the baby elephant!</strong></p>

<p>So happy this baby is alive. Good on you for doing that, very kind hearted person you are well done! Thank you for saving that sweet baby.<br />

<p dir="ltr"> A dog that had been missing for two months was rescued by a team of speleologists. Due to the layout of the building, their objective was especially challenging, as reported by positive-info.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Almost two months after disappearing on June 9, a dog named Abby was discovered and saved by cave divers on August 6.</p>

<p dir="ltr">When hunting for Abby, how did her family not notice that she had wandered off and ended up in a cave? Only she can provide a definitive response to this inquiry. Even though she had access to water and freshwater fish and crustaceans, it is unknown how she survived in this unfriendly and entirely dark habitat.</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, experts immediately went into action to save the puppy after learning that she had been seen in the Tom Moore subterranean tunnels between Brewer and Perryville in Missouri. The crew of cavers included Rick Haley and Gerry Keene. They went straight into the 35 km long maze. They eventually tracked down the animal, but freeing it was no easy task.</p>
</div>
<div class="HTML">
<p dir="ltr">They squished Abby into a 60-centimeter opening, then climbed the rock face 150 meters upward to the surface.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Robert Cahoon, deputy chief of the Biehle fire brigade, helped them outside. Between the two of them, they canvassed the area looking for the dog’s owners. Once they found the correct address, they were able to enter. Abby’s owners, who had given up hope that they would ever see their dog alive again after so much time had passed since she had vanished, were shocked. Back at home, the dog is taking it easy as she recovers from her ordeal.</p>

<h1><strong>Elephants are very loving, family oriented, compassionate animals who feel deeply!</strong></h1>
<p><strong>They are so family oriented taking care of the little one who lo.st his Mother.</strong><br />
HOW PRECIOUS!!

<p>Many people’s hearts were br.o.ken when the orp.haned baby elephants shared their gri.ef and comforted another baby elephant who has just [lo.st] his mother.<br />
The emotional moment occurred in 2018, when a crew from the “David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT)”, an elephant orp.hanage, was in the area on a routine patrol when they noticed the stranger sign. A young’s lone tracks in the sand along the Tiva River.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3">
<div id="M822805ScriptRootC1344714_08bca">
<div id="MarketGidComposite1344714_08bca"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3815" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_1-6-300x225-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They quickly discovered an [exh.aus.ted] baby elephant cr.ying for its mother. Unfortunately, his mother di.ed a long time ago, and he was rescued by these good people.</p>
<p>The orp.haned Mukkoka is a one-year-old elephant who was me.dically checked, properly fed with the orp.hanage’s miracle milk formula, and miraculously recovered within a few days.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3816" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_2-5-300x225-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>However, for an orp.haned elephant, life was nothing but difficult, so the volunteers decided to introduce Mukkoka to the new family. And the other elephants surrounded him with care and concern as soon as he met his new herd as if they could sense his sa.dness.</p>
<p>They enveloped him and led him out into the woods to meet the other of the herd. The other infants gave him a warm welcome, extending out their trunks to reassure and accept Mukkoka as a new member of the family.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3814" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/thumb-41-300x163.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="163" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/thumb-41-300x163.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/thumb-41.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>This image shows once again these creatures are special beyond human imagination. They have a great deal of compassion and empathy for others.</p>
<p>Mukkoka will most likely spend the next ten years in the care of the DSWT before being released back into the wild. Until then, he’ll heal and learn how to be an elephant, with help from his loving foster family every step of the way.</p>

<p>The baby elephant is now a member of a new family, and it will never be left behind, that’s for sure!</p>
<p>So sorry about the baby who lo.st his mom <img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f972.svg" alt="&#x1f972;" /> but grateful for the other Elephants who gave him so much love<img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/2764.svg" alt="&#x2764;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f499.svg" alt="&#x1f499;" /><br />
The human race could and should learn what Empathy is from what these wonderful Noble Animals are !!</p>
